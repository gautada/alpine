# Abstract: This script check some system information to determine
# the health of a running container.
# Specification:
# - Container postgres
# - Checks - Disk usage, crond running
# - Todo - Check server is available for client connection
#
# Container: Healthcheck Script
#
# The HEALTHCHECK instruction tells container manager how to
# test a container to check that it is still working. This can
# detect cases such as a web server that is stuck in an
# infinite loop and unable to handle new connections, even
# though the server process is still running.
#
# When a container has a healthcheck specified, it has a
# health status in addition to its normal status. This status
# is initially starting. Whenever a health check passes, it
# becomes healthy (whatever state it was previously in). After
# a certain number of consecutive failures, it becomes
# unhealthy.
#
# The commandâ€™s exit status indicates the health status of the container. The possible values are:
#
# - 0: success - the container is healthy and ready for use
# - 1: unhealthy - the container is not working correctly
# - 2: reserved - do not use this exit code
