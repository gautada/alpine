# This script is the control script to test container health. The default behavior is to
# call the `/etc/container/health` script which will load and run all specific scripts in
# `/etc/container/health.d/*.health`. This script also unifies health checks for startup,
# readiness, and liveness.  The default setup has all of the scripts `/usr/bin/container-liveness`,
# `/usr/bin/container-readiness`, and `/usr/bin/container-startup` point to this script
# `/usr/bin/container-health`.  To overide a downstream container should provide a specific
# respective file `/etc/container/[liveness, readiness, and/or startup]` that defines the
# desired behavior
